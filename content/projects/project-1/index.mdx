NexPass is an AI-driven finance management app designed to simplify expense tracking and empower users with clear financial insights.

### The Problem
Tracking finances can be overwhelming. Many users, including myself, have multiple bank accounts that often have varying use cases and spending patterns. Manually logging these expenses are time-consuming and boring. I set out to create a solution that automates the process and offers actionable insights.

### The Solution
NexPass leverages AI to analyze spending habits and automatically categorizes expenses. The app securely connects to bank accounts in a read-only mode, ensuring user data remains private while delivering accurate, real-time insights. The AI assistant processes transactions and provides answers and tips to specific questions, avoiding manually retrieving or searching for information oneself.

Built with Next.js 14 and React, NexPass offers a dynamic, server-rendered experience powered by TypeScript for type safety. Tailwind CSS keeps the design clean and responsive, while OpenAI fuels the intelligent insights behind our assistant. I use Appwrite for secure backend services and data management.

### Challenges and Learnings
Integrating multiple technologies while ensuring data privacy was challenging. Balancing a smooth user experience with robust security protocols required careful design and iterative testing. I learned a great deal about optimizing AI-driven workflows and the nuances of financial data handling.

### Final Thoughts
NexPass is just the beginning. By automating tedious financial tasks and providing smart insights, I hope to empower users to take control of their money effortlessly. Future improvements include deeper AI integrations and expanded bank connectivity options to further streamline personal finance management.
