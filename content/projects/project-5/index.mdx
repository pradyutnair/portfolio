Investment Council is an AI-powered investment analysis platform that orchestrates multiple AI models to provide comprehensive due diligence on investment opportunities. The system combines Google Gemini Deep Research with a multi-agent "council" approach, leveraging ChatGPT and Claude to deliver critical analysis from multiple perspectives.

## The Problem

Traditional investment research is time-consuming, expensive, and often biased. Analysts spend weeks compiling research reports, but these reports typically present only one perspective—the bullish case. Critical questions go unanswered: What could go wrong? What risks are being overlooked? What would a contrarian investor see? Without multiple viewpoints, investors make decisions with incomplete information, leading to poor risk-adjusted returns.

## The Solution

Investment Council transforms investment research into a structured, multi-perspective workflow that combines deep AI-powered research with critical analysis from specialized AI agents. Instead of a single analyst's report, you get:

- **Comprehensive Research**: Google Gemini Deep Research conducts thorough market and company analysis
- **Strategy-Specific Analysis**: Specialized agents evaluate opportunities through different investment lenses (Value, Special Situations, Distressed)
- **Critical Challenge**: The Skeptic agent tears apart the bullish case, finding flaws and hidden risks
- **Risk Assessment**: The Risk Officer systematically identifies regulatory, operational, financial, and ESG risks
- **Final Synthesis**: The Verdict Agent weighs all perspectives to produce INVEST/PASS/WATCH recommendations with conviction levels

This multi-agent approach ensures you see both sides of every investment opportunity before committing capital.

## How It Works

### The Research Workflow

Investment Council supports two primary workflows:

#### 1. Thesis-Based Research Sessions

Perfect for discovering multiple opportunities guided by an investment thesis. Ideal when you have a market view or strategy but need to find specific companies that fit.

**Workflow:**
1. **Define Your Thesis**: Enter an investment thesis (e.g., "Find undervalued small-cap tech stocks with strong cash flows trading below book value")
2. **Choose Your Strategy**: Select from Value Investing, Special Situations, Distressed Investing, or General Research
3. **Deep Research**: Gemini Deep Research analyzes the market, identifies opportunities, and produces comprehensive reports
4. **Council Critique**: The Skeptic and Risk Officer provide independent critiques of each opportunity
5. **Final Verdict**: The Verdict Agent synthesizes all perspectives into actionable recommendations

#### 2. Traditional Deal Memos

Focused analysis on a specific investment opportunity. Use this when you already have a company in mind and need comprehensive due diligence.

**Workflow:**
1. **Scout Phase**: Define the investment thesis for a specific company
2. **Research Phase**: Gemini produces a deep research report covering fundamentals, market position, competitive landscape, and financials
3. **Council Phase**: The Skeptic and Risk Officer critique the report in parallel
4. **Interrogation Phase**: Interactive Q&A with full context to address remaining questions
5. **Final Decision**: Record your INVEST/PASS/WATCH verdict with notes

### Investment Strategies

The platform supports four specialized investment research strategies, each with its own analytical framework:

#### Value Investing

Following Benjamin Graham and Bruce Greenwald principles, this strategy focuses on:
- **Margin of Safety**: Finding stocks trading significantly below intrinsic value
- **Asset Valuation**: Book value, earnings power value (EPV), and franchise value analysis
- **Financial Health**: Low debt-to-equity, strong current ratios, consistent cash flows
- **Competitive Moats**: Durable competitive advantages and sustainable business models

**Key Metrics**: P/E < 15, P/B < 1.5, Debt/Equity < 0.5, Current Ratio > 2

**Best For**: Long-term investors seeking undervalued companies with strong fundamentals

#### Special Situations

Joel Greenblatt-style event-driven investing focused on corporate events that create mispricing:
- **Spinoffs**: Parent companies divesting divisions, often creating undervalued opportunities
- **Merger Arbitrage**: Price spreads in announced mergers and acquisitions
- **Restructuring**: Companies undergoing operational or financial restructuring
- **Catalyst-Driven**: Clear timelines and events that unlock value

**Key Focus**: Identifying catalysts, mispricing from forced selling, and hidden value not reflected in current prices

**Best For**: Investors comfortable with event-driven strategies and defined timelines

#### Distressed Investing

Howard Marks and Oaktree-style contrarian investing during market cycles:
- **Market Cycle Analysis**: Identifying cycle bottoms and forced seller dynamics
- **Distressed Debt**: Companies or sectors experiencing significant distress
- **Turnaround Situations**: Beaten-down stocks with identifiable recovery paths
- **Asymmetric Risk/Reward**: Limited downside with significant upside potential

**Key Focus**: Stocks down 50%+ from highs, temporary vs. permanent distress, strong underlying assets

**Best For**: Contrarian investors comfortable with higher risk and volatility

#### General Research

Comprehensive company and market analysis without a specific strategy filter:
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Complete financial and operational review
- **Market Context**: Industry trends, competitive positioning, market share
- **Risk/Reward Assessment**: Asymmetric opportunity identification
- **Flexible Framework**: Adapts to any investment thesis

**Best For**: Investors exploring opportunities without a predefined strategy

## The Investment Council

The platform's namesake feature—a council of AI agents that provide independent critiques:

### The Skeptic

A professional short seller and contrarian investor that:
- Identifies overly optimistic assumptions
- Finds cherry-picked data and survivorship bias
- Highlights hidden risks and red flags
- Challenges bullish narratives with counter-evidence
- Quantifies valuation concerns and multiple compression risks

**Output**: Structured critique covering key concerns, missing analysis, base case vs. bear case scenarios

### The Risk Officer

A Chief Risk Officer that systematically assesses:
- **Regulatory & Legal Risks**: Compliance issues, litigation exposure
- **Operational Risks**: Execution challenges, management capacity
- **Financial Risks**: Leverage, liquidity, cash burn, covenant risks
- **Market & Competition Risks**: Disruption threats, market share loss
- **Macro & Systemic Risks**: Interest rates, recession, sector headwinds
- **ESG Risks**: Environmental, social, and governance concerns

**Output**: Comprehensive risk assessment with probability × impact analysis and mitigation recommendations

### The Verdict Agent

Synthesizes all perspectives into final recommendations:
- Weighs research, strategy analysis, skeptic critique, and risk assessment
- Produces INVEST/PASS/WATCH recommendations with conviction levels (0-100%)
- Provides position sizing guidance and risk management parameters
- Identifies remaining questions and due diligence items
- Calculates fair value estimates and margin of safety

**Decision Framework**:
- **INVEST** (≥60% conviction): Attractive risk-adjusted return, credible bull case, manageable concerns
- **PASS**: Unattractive risk/reward, weak bull case, significant concerns
- **WATCH** (40-60% conviction): Interesting but needs more information or better entry point

## Interrogation Phase

After receiving research and critiques, the Interrogation Phase allows you to:
- Ask questions about specific aspects of the investment
